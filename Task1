/*A simple calculator is a basic software application designed to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It typically features a user-friendly interface with numeric buttons and operational keys, allowing users to input values and execute calculations with ease. This project often serves as an introductory exercise in programming, helping beginners understand fundamental concepts such as user input, conditional statements, and basic algorithm design. The simplicity of the calculator makes it an ideal starting point for learning and practicing coding skills.*/
